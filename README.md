# SQLite-React

This project demonstrates the use of **SQLite with WebAssembly (WASM)** and **Origin Private File System (OPFS)** within a React application. It allows you to run SQL queries directly in the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- **React + Vite** app for a blazing-fast development experience.
- Supports **SQLite databases** in the browser via **WASM**.
- Stores databases in the **OPFS** for persistent file handling.
- Easily switch between databases to run custom SQL queries.

## 📦 Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## 🏃 Running the Application

Start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite).

## 🗂️ Default Database

- The application ships with a **dummy database** (`mydb.sqlite`), which is loaded by default.
- You can execute SQL queries against this database directly in the app interface.

## 🔄 Switching Databases

If you want to use a different SQLite database, simply upload the new `.sqlite` file through the app interface and start querying on it right away.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool optimized for modern JavaScript development.
- **SQLite + WASM**: Enables SQLite to run in the browser via WebAssembly.
- **OPFS**: Provides secure and persistent file storage within the browser.
